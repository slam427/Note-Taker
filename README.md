## Description

A web based application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
